layout: page
title: Page # put your title here
# permalink: /page/
# put the permalink here; as written, the url for this page would be http://[username].github.io/page/
# if you omit the permalink field, the url will simply be the name of the file (page.md becomes /page, which is effectively equivalent)

To add a page, simply copy this file and update the title and link. (Make sure the ```layout``` remains ```page```.)
